Five Key Elements 五大关键要素	

The AENB BSA/AML Policy addresses five key elements (or pillars) of a BSA/AML Program, which include: AENB BSA/AML政策处理BSA/AML计划的五个关键要素（或支柱），其中包括

The Designation of a BSA/AML Officer BSA/AML高级人员的指定	

A BSA/AML Officer is designated to coordinate and monitor day-to-day compliance with BSA/AML requirements. 名BSA/AML高级人员须负责协调和监控日常遵守BSA/AML规定的情况；

AENB is also subject to Information Sharing requirements that were established by Section 314(a) of the USA PATRIOT Act. AENB还须遵守美国爱国者法案第314（a）条确定的信息共享要求。	

Section 314(a) allows the U.S. government to require AENB to identify any relevant customer accounts or transactions associated with subjects of significant money laundering or terrorist financing investigations. 第314（）条允许政府要求AENB识别与重大洗钱或恐怖主义融资调查有关的任何相关客户账户或交易。	

Section 314(b) of the USA PATRIOT Act allows financial institutions, such as AENB, to voluntarily share information with other participating financial institutions related to money laundering or terrorist financing investigations. 美国爱国者法案314（b）条允许金融机构，例如AENB，自愿与其他参与金融机构的金融机构分享与洗钱或恐怖主义融资调查有关的信息；

What is Terrorist Financing? 什么是恐怖主义融资	

ke any criminal gang, a terrorist organization needs money. 像任何犯罪团伙样，恐怖组织需要资金。	

But unlike most gangs, not all this money comes from criminal activities. 但与大多数帮派不同，并不是所有这些钱都来自犯罪活动。  	

Terrorist organizations have numerous sources of income, and they use a range of methods to move funds, often internationally, while avoiding detection. 恐怖主义组织有许多收入来源，他们使用系列的方法，通常在国际范围内转移资金，同时避免检测。	

In money laundering, the aim is to make dirty money appear to be clean – but terrorist financing often starts with money from legitimate sources. 在洗钱方面，目的是让脏钱看起来干净——但恐怖主义融资往往是从合法来源的钱开始的。	

It’s the end results that are criminal. 它规定了犯罪的最终结果。	



How Do Terrorists Raise Funds? 恐怖分子如何筹集资金	

Legitimate sources include: 合法来源包括	

Private donations 私人捐款	

Legitimate commercial enterprises 合法的商业企业	

Legitimate non-profit or religious organizations 合法的非营利组织或宗教组织	

Criminal sources include: 犯罪来源包括	
br

Proceeds of criminal activity, such as narcotics, fraud, robbery, kidnapping, and extortion 犯罪活动的所得，例如毒品，欺诈，抢劫，绑架和勒索	

Conflict resources, such as oil, diamonds, or minerals 冲突资源，如石油，钻石或矿产	

Shell companies or charities 壳公司或慈善机构	

Sponsorship by rogue states 流氓国家赞助	

More recently, groups have been raising income from appeals on social media or even using crowdfunding sites. 最近，越来越多的团体通过社会媒体的申诉或甚至使用拥挤的资助网站来提高收入。	
br


Movement of Funds 基金的移动	

Terrorists often use similar techniques to money launderers to transfer funds. 恐怖分子往往使用类似的技术来洗钱者转移资金。	

For example, the regulated banking system is used to move illegal opium profits from Afghanistan to safe financial havens abroad.Terrorists also use less well-regulated systems, such as money remittance businesses.And they use informal systems such as Hawalas – trust-based remittance agencies popular across the Middle East and South Asia.Finally, they still use the oldest method of transfer – physically transporting the cash. 例如，受监管的银行系统用于将非法的鸦片利润从阿富汗转移到海外安全的金融避风港。恐怖分子也使用不那么完善的系统，比如汇款业务。他们使用非正规系统，比如中东和南亚流行的Hawalas—基于信任的汇款机构。最终，他们仍然使用最古老的转移方式——有形运输现金。	


How Does Terrorist Financing Differ from Money Laundering? 恐怖分子融资与洗钱活动有何不同	

While traditional money laundering investigations aim to link funds to a criminal act that has already taken place, terrorist financing investigations try to stop terrorists getting access to funds for future activities. 虽然传统的洗钱调查旨在将资金与已经发生的犯罪行为联系起来，但恐怖主义融资调查却试图阻止恐怖分子获得资金供将来的活动使用；	

Also, the traditional money laundering process is circular, with the “clean” money coming back to the criminals that started the process. 同样，传统的洗钱程序也是循环的，有笔干净的现金归还给开始这个过程的罪犯。	

The terrorist financing route is linear, with money moving from the donor or source to the terrorist that will use the funds. 恐怖主义融资途径是线性的，资金从捐赠者或来源转移到将使用资金的恐怖分子手中。	

Terrorist financing transactions also tend to be smaller than typical money laundering cases, and, when the funds come from legitimate sources, they can be difficult to detect. 恐怖主义融资交易往往比典型的洗钱案件更小，当资金来自合法来源时，它们很难被发现。	


It’s Up to You 它向你致以谢意	

Financial intelligence is critically important in the fight against terrorism. 金融情报在打击恐怖主义的斗争中极为重要。	

Detecting and reporting red flags for terrorist financing is the most effective way to stop the flow of terrorist funds. 检测和报告资助恐怖主义资金的红旗，是制止恐怖主义资金流动的最有效途径。	

That’s why it’s important you stay vigilant for any signs of suspicious activity and that you report them to the appropriate channels. 这就是为什么你要保持警惕任何可疑活动的迹象，并将他们报告给合适的渠道。	

To report your suspicions, inform your Compliance Officer or the Financial Intelligence Unit via the CompRef ACI. 如欲举报你的怀疑，可通过"契约"向你的合规官或金融情报部门报告。	

Remember, financial records can be linked to terrorists. 请记住，财务记录可以与恐怖分子联系起来。	

Following the flow of funds from the point of origin to the terrorist operatives can help investigators uncover terrorist cells and the networks that support them. 从原点到恐怖分子特工的资金流动可以帮助调查人员发现恐怖分子细胞和支持他们的网络。

Red Flags for Terrorist Financing 资助恐怖主义的红旗	


Red Flags for Terrorist Financing 资助恐怖主义的红旗	

It’s vital that you report terrorist financing red flags promptly, but can you spot a red flag?Let’s look at some common examples. 很重要的是，你要迅速举报恐怖分子资助红旗，但是你是否可以看到个红旗。让我们看看些常见的例子。	


Tips and Lists 提示和列表	

One obvious red flag is an indication in the media or from law enforcement that a client supports violent extremism or radicalization, or is under investigation for terrorist links.You can also check suspect individuals and companies against terrorist watch lists: 个明显的红色标志是媒体或执法机构表示，个客户支持暴力极端主义或激进主义，或正在调查恐怖主义联系。你也可以依据恐怖监视名单检查可疑的个人和公司。	

Public lists – such as those compiled by the UN, EU, and US 公开名单——例如联合国，欧盟和美国编制的文件	

Internal watch lists compiled by the company 公司编制的内部监控列表	


High-Risk Areas 高风险区域	

Other red flag activities are related to high-risk areas. 其他红旗活动也与高风险地区有关。	

These are countries that are known to be deficient in countering terrorist financing or are known supporters of terrorist groups.Suspect activities include travelling to the area, using debit or credit cards in the area, money transfers to or from the area, or donations to local organizations.In some cases, such as active conflict zones, this also applies to countries or regions bordering high-risk areas. 这些国家被称为缺乏打击恐怖主义资金的国家，也是恐怖组织的已知支持者。可疑活动包括前往该地区，使用该地区的借记卡或信用卡，向该地区或从该地区转移资金或向当地组织捐款。在有些情况下，如活跃的冲突区，这也适用于接近高危地区的国家或地区。	


Suspicious Activities 可疑活动	

Suspicious financial activities include: 可疑的财务活动包括	

Foreign currency transactions shortly followed by fund transfers to high-risk locations 外币交易不久之后，基金转往高风险地点	

Sudden settlement of debts by unrelated third parties 不相关的第三方债务的突然结算	

Numerous email transfers between the client and unrelated third parties 客户与无关第三方之间的大量电子邮件传输	

Multiple variations of name, address, phone number, or additional identifiers in account documents 账户文件中的姓名，地址，电话号码或其他标识符的多种变体

Indication of a planned end date to account activity 活动的计划结束日期的指示

Suspicious Lodgments 可疑Lodgments	

Franz is reviewing the account of Dr. Cham, a Sudanese citizen who is a resident in the US. 弗兰兹正在审查名苏丹公民dram Cham的身份，他是美国居民。	

He notices numerous small amounts of money lodged into the client’s account from different accounts located in various US states.When he makes inquiries, Dr. Cham explains that he could not open an account for his Sudanese charity in the US for tax reasons. 他注意到，在美国各州的不同账户中，有大量的钱存入客户的客户帐户中。当他提问的时候，dram Cham解释说由于税收的原因，他无法为他在美国的苏丹慈善机构开立帐户。	

He is using his private account to collect donations and will withdraw the donations in cash and personally bring the money to the Sudan. 他使用自己的私人账户来收集捐款，并将以现金方式撤回捐款并亲自把钱给苏丹。	

Franz suspects the charity could be a front for terrorist financing. 弗兰兹怀疑这个慈善机构可能是资助恐怖主义的线。	

What two things should Franz do? 弗朗茨应该做什么两件事	



Confront the client with his suspicions 以他的怀疑面对客户	

Conduct further enquiries into Dr. Cham and the charity, without tipping Dr. Cham off, to see if there is any known association with extremist groups 进一步查询dram Cham和慈善机构，不要给dram Cham送假，看看与极端团体是否有任何已知的关联	

Report his suspicions immediately using the appropriate channels 使用相应的渠道立即报告他的疑虑	

Inform local law enforcement agencies of suspected terrorist activity 告知地方执法机构可疑的恐怖活动	
p149

Thanks for helping Franz! 谢谢你帮助弗朗茨	

As an individual colleague, you have two key responsibilities – client due diligence and activity reporting. 作为个个人同事，你有两个关键责任——客户尽职调查和活动报告。	

Client due diligence (CDD) means that you verify your client's identity and credentials and conduct ongoing monitoring of their transactions and relationships. 客户尽职调查（CDD）意味着您验证客户'的身份和凭证，并持续监控他们的交易和关系。	

CDD also means identifying the beneficial owners of funds and assets. 加强权还意味着确定资金和资产的实益拥有人。	

All colleagues who deal with clients must comply with the CDD procedures in place. 所有与客户打交道的同事都必须遵守相关的附加程序。	

Your second responsibility is reporting suspicious activity through the proper channels. 你的责任是通过合适的渠道报告可疑活动。	

Always remember that discussing your suspicions outside of the reporting process is “tipping off.” 请始终记住，在报告过程之外讨论您的疑虑是切题	

Tipping off is against company policy, and in most jurisdictions, it’s also a criminal offense. 小费是违反公司政策的，在大多数司法管辖区，这也是刑事犯罪。

Nadia’s client wants to wire €250,000 to its subsidiary in the Middle East. 纳迪亚的客户希望向其中东€250,000的子公司支付美元的费用。	

When she reviews the account, Nadia notices that the client's account has received more than €475,000 in cash transfers over the past six months.The transfers have come from different legitimate European companies in various sectors, but with no apparent economic purpose. 当她审查帐户时，Nadia注意到在过去的个月中，该€475,000客户'的帐户已收到了超过$美元的现金转账。这些转移来自不同行业的不同合法的欧洲公司，但没有明显的经济用途。	

She then finds that the beneficial owners of the various companies were all originally from the Middle East. 她随后发现，各家公司的实益拥有人最初都来自中东地区。	

Nadia suspects the transactions may be linked to terrorist financing. Nadia怀疑交易可能与资助恐怖主义有关。	

What should Nadia do? Nadia应该做什么	


Report her suspicions using the approved company channels 使用批准的公司渠道报告她的疑虑	

Contact the client and ask them to explain the cash transfers into the account 联系客户，让他们解释汇入帐户的现金	

Inform local law enforcement agencies that she has uncovered a terrorist group 通知当地执法机构她发现了恐怖组织	

Authorize the transaction; many businesses in developing economies are cash-based 授权交易；发展中国家的许多企业都是以现金为基础的	
p151

Thanks for helping Nadia! 感谢您帮助Nadia	

Client due diligence (CDD) and suspicious activity reporting (SAR) are our first line of defense in the fight against terrorist financing. 客户尽职调查（CDD）和可疑活动报告（SAR）是我们打击恐怖主义融资的首个防线。	

Remember, although one red flag on its own may seem insignificant, when combined with others, it could provide reasonable grounds for suspicion. 请记住，虽然个红旗本身看起来微不足道，但与他人结合时，它可以为怀疑提供合理的理由。	

If you become aware of an issue, or have any terrorist financing concerns, inform your Compliance Officer or the Financial Intelligence Unit via the CompRef ACI. 如果你意识到某个问题，或者有任何的恐怖主义融资问题，请通过计算委员会通知你的合规部官员或金融情报部门。	

p152





Money for terrorist financing comes from both legitimate and criminal sources. 资助恐怖主义的资金来自合法来源和犯罪来源；	



In terrorist financing, unlike money laundering, the people who start the process are not normally the ultimate beneficiaries of the funding. 与洗钱不同，在资助恐怖主义方面，开始这过程的人通常不是资助的最终受益者。	



Customer due diligence and suspicious activity reporting are our first line of defense in the fight against terrorist financing. 客户尽职调查和可疑活动报告是我们打击恐怖主义融资的条防线。	



Once the identity of an account holder has been verified, the identity of the beneficial owners of funds and assets is not relevant. 旦账户持有人的身份被核实，基金和资产的实益拥有人的身份就不相关了。	



Following the flow of funds from the donor to the terrorist operative can help investigators uncover terrorist cells. 从捐赠者到恐怖组织的资金流动后，调查人员可以帮助调查人员发现恐怖分子细胞。

The frequency of the training should be based upon risk. 培训的频率应以风险为基础；	

Independent Testing – This periodic testing is generally performed by the American Express Independent Audit Group (“IAG”) and measures the business’s adherence to the AML program. 独立测试—这次定期测试通常由美国运通独立审计小组（LIG '）执行，并测量商业规则对AML程序的遵守情况。	

p154

Assessing and Controlling Risk 评估和控制风险	

Different business activities within American Express, different types of customers, and different products and services present varying degrees of potential money laundering risks. 美国运通，不同类型的客户以及不同的产品和服务的不同业务活动呈现不同程度的潜在洗钱风险。	

It is important that we assess the nature and extent of the possible money laundering and terrorist financing risks. 我们必须评估可能发生的洗钱和恐怖主义融资风险的性质和范围。	

Below are examples of the risk factors and measures associated with the risk areas. 以下是与风险范畴相关的风险因素及措施的例子：	



Risk factors and measures (examples) include: 风险因素及措施（例子）包括	

Relationship type, length of relationship, industry, location of customers. 关系类型，关系长度，行业和客户的位置；	

Products and Services 产品和服务	

Risk factors and measures (examples) include: 风险因素及措施（例子）包括	

cash or cash equivalent, rapid and/or large transfer of value, cross-border transfer. 现金或现金等同价，快速和/或大规模的价值转移，跨境转移；

Your business’s risk assessment will determine how much due diligence is required, including ongoing monitoring. 您的业务流程风险评估将决定需要多少尽职调查，包括持续监控；
p155






Reporting Suspicious Activity 报告可疑活动	

Unusual or suspicious activity is an activity that has no business or apparent lawful purpose, or is not the type of activity the particular customer would normally be expected to engage, and for which there is no reasonable explanation. 不寻常或可疑的活动是没有业务或明显的合法目的的活动，或者不是特定客户通常期望参与的活动类型，没有合理解释。	

Financial Intelligence Unit 金融情报部门	

The Financial Intelligence Unit (“FIU”), with input from your Compliance Officer, is responsible for developing and implementing processes to monitor customer transactions and activity. 金融情报部门（HFIU in），在您的合规人员的建议下负责制定和实施监控客户交易和活动的流程。	

These processes are designed to detect unusual customer activity throughout the life of the relationship. 这些流程被设计为检测在整个关系的整个生命周期中的异常客户活动。	

When customer activity has been determined to be potentially suspicious or potentially criminal in nature, appropriate action must be taken – including reports made to government authorities in accordance with applicable laws. 当客户活动被确定为潜在的可疑或者潜在的犯罪性质时，必须采取适当的行动，包括根据适用法律向政府当局报告的报告。	

The FIU, in conjunction with each business, must satisfy all legal obligations to report suspicious activity involving possible money laundering or terrorist financing. 金融联盟应与每项业务合作，履行所有法律义务，报告涉及可能进行洗钱或资助恐怖主义活动的可疑活动。	

Documented procedures and controls should also cover reporting of suspicious activity to government authorities in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. 记录的程序和控制程序还应当包括根据适用的法律和条例向政府当局报告可疑活动。	

Recognizing and Reporting Unusual Activity 认识和报告不寻常的活动	

Being able to recognize unusual or suspicious activity is critical in identifying potential money laundering or terrorist financing. 能够识别异常或可疑的活动对确定潜在的洗钱或恐怖主义融资至关重要。	

Although the American Express Financial Intelligence unit (“FIU”) is responsible for developing and implementing appropriate methods for monitoring customer activity and transactions to detect unusual activity, all colleagues have a responsibility to identify and escalate unusual activity. 尽管美国运通金融情报部门（ChFIU）负责制定和实施监测客户活动和交易的适当方法，以检测不寻常的活动，但所有同事都有责任识别和升级不正常的活动。	

To do so, it’s important to understand what is unusual or suspicious activity relative to your business (based on your customers and products). 为此，了解相对于您的业务存在的异常或可疑活动（基于您的客户和产品）非常重要；	

While the techniques of money laundering and terrorist financing are varied and evolving, knowledge of the customer is a key component in understanding if the activity is unusual or suspect. 虽然洗钱和资助恐怖主义的技术多种多样，而且不断发展，但对客户的了解是了解这项活动是否不寻常或可疑的个关键组成部分。	

If you encounter any unusual activity or unusual interactions with customers that could require analysis or investigation to determine suspiciousness, please inform your Compliance Officer or the FIU via the CompRef ACI. 如果您遇到任何不寻常的活动或与客户发生的不寻常的互动，可能需要分析或调查来确定怀疑程度，请通过计算确认信通知您的合规人员或金融机构。	

Common Indicators to be Aware Of 须知悉的一般指标

The methods criminals use to disguise the origins and purpose of their funds are changing and developing all the time. 犯罪分子用来掩饰自己的资金来源和目的的方法直在发生变化和发展。	

It is difficult to make a definitive list of transactions and behaviors that are unusual or suspicious. 很难制定出个异常或可疑的交易和行为清单。	

There are a number of common indicators of unusual or suspicious activity, often referred to as “red flags” of which you should be aware: 有许多常见的异常或可疑活动的指标，经常被称为"红色信号"，你应该知道这点。

Recognizing Your Suspicions 承认你的怀疑	

If you become aware that unusual or suspicious activity is taking place, you would always take action. 如果你意识到发生了不寻常或可疑的活动，你总是采取行动。	

Remember that a customer’s circumstances, such as their personal or account transaction history, can change. 请记住，客户的情况，比如他们的个人或账户交易历史，可能会发生变化。	

If there is no clear reason for the change in a customer’s activity, their behavior or the transactions they are conducting, you should escalate the matter by following the policies and procedures that apply to your business. 如果客户的活动，行为或交易所进行的交易没有明确的原因，您应该按照适用于您业务的政策和程序来升级该问题。	

If you do not take action in a timely fashion, you could put yourself and American Express at risk. 如果不及时采取行动，你能站和美国运通处于危险之中。	

If in doubt, always promptly escalate the matter to your Compliance Officer or the FIU via the CompRef ACI. 如有疑问，请随时将此事立即呈报给你的合规人员或金融区委员会。	

Remember, by escalating unusual or suspicious activity, you are following American Express policies and procedures and meeting your obligations as an colleague. 请记住，通过升级不寻常或可疑的活动，您正在遵循美国运通政策和程序，并履行您作为同事的义务。	

Reporting Responsibilities 报告责任

Most countries have severe penalties for failure to report suspicions of money laundering activities. 大多数国家因未能报告对洗钱活动的怀疑而遭受严厉处罚。	

It is therefore vital that you know the escalation channels within your business. 因此，您必须了解业务中的升级渠道是至关重要的。	

After you have escalated your concerns, the FIU, in conjunction with your Compliance Officer will determine whether a suspicious activity report needs to be filed. 在您升级了您的疑虑后，金融机构与您的合规人员将决定是否需要提交可疑的活动报告。	

If you know or suspect that a suspicious activity report has been filed, you must not take any action that would prejudice a resulting investigation, such as disclosing the report to the person involved. 如果你知道或怀疑个可疑的活动报告已经提交，你不能采取任何会影响所得调查的行动，比如向所涉及的人披露该报告。	

In many countries, it is a criminal violation to disclose that a transaction has been or may be reported to those who may be involved in the activity or to any person who is the subject of a suspicious activity report. 在许多国家，披露交易是否已或可能报告给可能参与该活动的人士或任何作为可疑活动报告标的的人，是刑事违规行为。

Recognizing and Reporting Insider Abuse 认识及报告内幕滥用	

As with recognizing unusual or suspicious customer activity, it is critical to be able to recognize insider abuse. 在识别不寻常或可疑的客户活动时，能够识别内部虐待至关重要。
